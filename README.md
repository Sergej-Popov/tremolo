## TODO

Add an abilitity to paste youtube videos (pasting youtube url).
It would embed the video. Video just like other elements, needs to be draggable and resizable.
however, unlike images, video must always maintain ratio.


Add ability to crop images through makeCroppable. Only images to be croppable.
Crop, must not be permanent. When cropping an already cropped element, i should be able to recover the previously cropped space.
So, essentially the cropping should be done my masking. Area outside of mask, should be semi transparent.
Crop is triggered by 'c' hotkey.
